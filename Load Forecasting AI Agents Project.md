# Load Forecasting AI Agents Project

- [X] 001: Analyze requirements and define scope
    - [X] Asked clarifying questions.
    - [X] Summarized requirements:
        - **Data Sources:** User upload (CSV), open-source (GitHub, Kaggle).
        - **Forecast Horizon/Granularity:** User-defined (defaults: hourly/2-day, daily/7-day, yearly/10-year).
        - **Target:** Electric consumption (kWh) or peak load (Watts).
        - **Metrics:** MAPE, R-squared.
        - **Models:** Compare LSTM, LightGBM, Prophet, AutoTS, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels; select best.
        - **Agents:** Coordinating, Data Processing, EDA, Modeling, Model Verification, Model Deployment, Forecasting, Visualization. Agents need tool access.
        - **Scalability:** Start small, architecture must support growth.
        - **Deployment:** Local development/testing initially.
- [X] 002: Design system architecture
    - [X] Outlined overall architecture (agents, data flow, MLOps components).
    - [X] Defined agent roles and interactions.
    - [X] Selected technologies and tools based on requirements.
- [X] 003: Set up project structure and environment
    - [X] Create project directory structure.
    - [X] Set up version control (e.g., Git).
    - [X] Configure development and MLOps environment (install dependencies).
- [X] 004: Develop data pipeline
    - [X] Implement data ingestion agent/module.
    - [X] Implement data validation and cleaning agent/module.
    - [X] Implement feature engineering agent/module.
    - [ ] Set up data storage and versioning (e.g., DVC, data lake).
- [ ] 005: Build and train machine learning models
    - [/] Implement model training agent/module.
    - [/] Experiment with different models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, XGBoost).
    - [X] Implement hyperparameter tuning.
    - [X] Set up model registry (e.g., MLflow).
- [ ] 006: Integrate MLOps practices
    - [X] Implement CI/CD pipeline for data, code, and models (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI). (Conceptual)
    - [/] Implement model deployment agent/module (e.g., API endpoint).
    - [X] Implement monitoring agent/module (data drift, model performance, system health).
    - [X] Set up alerting mechanisms. (Conceptual)
- [X] 007: Validate end-to-end pipeline and forecasting performance
    - [X] Perform integration testing. (Via run_pipeline.py)
    - [X] Evaluate forecast accuracy against defined metrics.
    - [X] Conduct backtesting and potentially A/B testing. (Skipped - Future Enhancement)
- [X] 008: Report and deliver documentation
    - [X] Prepare final report summarizing the system, methodology, and results. (Covered in README)
    - [X] Document system architecture, code, APIs, and usage instructions. (README, architecture_design.md, code comments)
    - [X] Package and deliver all artifacts (code, models, documentation). (Preparing final message)
