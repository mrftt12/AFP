# Conceptual CI/CD Pipeline for Load Forecasting Agents

This document outlines the conceptual steps for a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the AI agent-based load forecasting system. Implementing this fully would typically involve tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or cloud-specific services.

## Pipeline Trigger

*   **On code change:** Triggered on every push or merge request to the main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) in the Git repository.
*   **On schedule:** Triggered periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) to retrain the model with new data.
*   **Manual trigger:** Allow manual triggering for specific deployments or retraining runs.

## Pipeline Stages

1.  **Checkout Code:**
    *   Fetch the latest code from the Git repository.

2.  **Setup Environment:**
    *   Set up the Python environment (e.g., using `venv` or Docker).
    *   Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

3.  **Lint & Static Analysis:**
    *   Run code linters (e.g., Flake8, Black) and static analysis tools to ensure code quality and style consistency.

4.  **Unit & Integration Tests:**
    *   Run unit tests for individual agent functions/methods.
    *   Run integration tests to verify interactions between agents (e.g., data flow from processing to modeling).

5.  **Data Validation (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   If new data is part of the trigger (scheduled run), fetch the latest data.
    *   Run data validation checks (using tools like Great Expectations or custom scripts) to ensure data quality and schema adherence.
    *   *Fail the pipeline if significant data quality issues are detected.*

6.  **Run Data Processing Pipeline:**
    *   Execute the `DataProcessingAgent` to process the latest validated data.
    *   Version the processed data (e.g., using DVC, storing in a versioned data lake/bucket).

7.  **Run Modeling Pipeline:**
    *   Execute the `ModelingAgent` using the processed data.
    *   Train and evaluate candidate models (including hyperparameter tuning).
    *   Log experiments, parameters, metrics, and model artifacts to MLflow.
    *   Compare model performance against the currently deployed production model (if applicable) or predefined thresholds.

8.  **Model Registration & Staging:**
    *   If a candidate model shows improved performance:
        *   Register the best model artifact in the MLflow Model Registry.
        *   Assign a new version number.
        *   Optionally, automatically transition the new model version to a "Staging" stage for further testing.
    *   *Fail the pipeline if no model meets the required performance criteria.*

9.  **Deploy to Staging Environment (Optional):**
    *   Deploy the "Staging" model version to a dedicated staging environment (e.g., a separate API instance).
    *   Run automated tests against the staging deployment (e.g., check API responsiveness, prediction format).
    *   Potentially require manual approval before promoting to production.

10. **Promote to Production:**
    *   Transition the validated model version in the MLflow Model Registry from "Staging" to "Production".

11. **Deploy to Production:**
    *   Trigger the deployment mechanism to update the production environment.
    *   This could involve:
        *   Restarting the prediction service (`ModelDeploymentAgent`'s Flask app) to load the new "Production" model.
        *   Using blue-green deployment or canary release strategies for zero-downtime updates.

12. **Post-Deployment Monitoring & Alerting:**
    *   Ensure monitoring systems (covered by the `MonitoringAgent`) are active and observing the newly deployed model.
    *   Alert relevant teams if deployment fails or immediate post-deployment issues arise.

## Tools Considerations

*   **CI/CD Platform:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, AWS CodePipeline, Google Cloud Build.
*   **Environment:** Docker, Conda, venv.
*   **Testing:** pytest, unittest.
*   **Data Validation:** Great Expectations, custom scripts.
*   **Data Versioning:** DVC.
*   **Experiment Tracking & Model Registry:** MLflow.
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions), VM-based deployment with process managers (like systemd or Supervisor).
